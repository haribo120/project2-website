        <h2>Hello! My name is Hari Kang.</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a senior majoring in Data Science. Ever since I started exploring the field, I have been fascinated by the power of data and how it can be transformed into meaningful insights. 
            I love my major because it allows me to work with various datasets, visualize complex information in an intuitive way, and make predictions based on real-world trends. Whether it’s analyzing business data, 
            understanding consumer behavior, or forecasting future trends, I enjoy uncovering patterns that help solve real-world problems.
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Love Data Science</h3>
        <p>
            One of the aspects I find most exciting about Data Science is the ability to <strong>tell a story through data visualization</strong>. 
            Numbers and raw data can often feel overwhelming, but when presented through clear and engaging visualizations, they become easier to interpret and can lead to more informed decision-making. 
            Additionally, working with machine learning models to make data-driven predictions is something I am eager to explore further.
        </p>

        <h3>My Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <p>
            Beyond academics, I have a deep passion for <strong>cooking</strong>. I love trying out new recipes and challenging myself with different cuisines every day. 
            Cooking is not just a hobby for me—it’s a way to be creative, experiment with flavors, and share delicious meals with the people around me. I find great joy in perfecting a dish and seeing others enjoy my food.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to cooking, I also enjoy <strong>going for walks</strong> and spending time outdoors. Walking allows me to clear my mind, relax, and appreciate the simple things in life. 
            Whether it’s a short stroll around my neighborhood or a long walk in nature, I always feel refreshed and inspired afterward.
        </p>

        <h3>My Future Goals</h3>
        <p>
            As I move forward in my academic and professional journey, I hope to combine my passion for Data Science with my personal interests. 
            My goal is to use data-driven insights to improve people's lives, whether through technology, health analytics, or even applications in food and sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always eager to learn new things, take on challenges, and collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for innovation and problem-solving.
