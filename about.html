            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Hari Kang</strong>. I am currently a senior majoring in <strong>Data Science</strong>.  
            Ever since I started exploring the field, I have been fascinated by the power of data and how it can be transformed into meaningful insights.  
            I love my major because it allows me to work with various datasets, visualize complex information in an intuitive way, and make predictions based on real-world trends.</p>

            <p>One of the aspects I find most exciting about Data Science is the ability to tell a story through data visualization.  
            Numbers and raw data can often feel overwhelming, but when presented through clear and engaging visualizations, they become easier to interpret and can lead to more informed decision-making.  
            Additionally, working with machine learning models to make data-driven predictions is something I am eager to explore further.</p>

            <p>As I move forward in my academic and professional journey, I hope to combine my passion for Data Science with my personal interests.  
            My goal is to use data-driven insights to improve people's lives, whether through technology, health analytics, or even applications in food and sustainability.</p>

            <p>I am always eager to learn new things, take on challenges, and collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for innovation and problem-solving.  
            If you’d like to connect, feel free to explore the rest of my website!</p>

        <section class="about-content">
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Beyond academics, I have a deep passion for <strong>cooking</strong>. I love trying out new recipes and challenging myself with different cuisines every day.  
            Cooking is not just a hobby for me—it’s a way to be creative, experiment with flavors, and share delicious meals with the people around me.</p>

            <p>In addition to cooking, I also enjoy <strong>going for walks and spending time outdoors</strong>.  
            Walking allows me to clear my mind, relax, and appreciate the simple things in life.  
            Whether it’s a short stroll around my neighborhood or a long walk in nature, I always feel refreshed and inspired afterward.</p>
