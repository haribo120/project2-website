        <h2>What is Intersectionality?</h2>
        <p>
            The term <strong>Intersectionality</strong> was coined by legal scholar <strong>Kimberlé Crenshaw</strong> to describe how various forms of discrimination—such as racism, sexism, classism, and ableism—overlap and intersect, creating unique experiences of oppression and privilege.
        </p>
        <p>
            Intersectionality helps us understand that individuals are not affected by a single axis of identity, but rather by the complex interactions of multiple social categories.

        <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Implicit Bias</strong> refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an automatic way. These biases develop over time through cultural exposure, socialization, and media influence, often without our conscious awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike explicit biases, which people are aware of, implicit biases operate beneath the surface, shaping our behaviors in subtle yet powerful ways.

                In this TEDx talk, Dushaw Hockett explores strategies for recognizing and addressing implicit biases, showing how self-awareness and deliberate action can lead to a more inclusive world.

    <section class="resource-section">
        <h2>Take the Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Implicit Association Test (IAT)</strong>, developed by researchers at Harvard University, measures implicit biases by analyzing how quickly individuals associate positive or negative words with certain groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can take the test yourself to explore your own unconscious biases and gain awareness of how they may influence your perceptions and decisions.
