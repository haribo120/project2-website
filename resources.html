            <h2>What is Intersectionality?</h2>
            <p>
                The term <strong>Intersectionality</strong> was coined by legal scholar <strong>KimberlÃ© Crenshaw</strong> to describe how multiple forms of discriminationâ€”such as racism, sexism, classism, and ableismâ€”overlap and create unique experiences of oppression and privilege.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding intersectionality is crucial because it shows that individuals are not affected by a single identity but rather by the interconnected nature of various social categories.

            <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Implicit Bias</strong> refers to unconscious attitudes, stereotypes, and preferences that influence our judgments and behaviors toward others, often without our awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
                These biases are shaped by cultural norms, media exposure, and personal experiences. Unlike explicit bias, which is deliberate and conscious, implicit bias operates subconsciously and affects real-world decisions, including hiring, policing, healthcare, and education.

            <h2>Examples of Implicit Bias</h2>

            <div class="bias-example">
                <h3>1. Gender Bias</h3>
                <p>Women are often overlooked for leadership positions despite having equal qualifications as men.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a 2012 Yale study, researchers found that science faculty members rated male applicants as more competent and offered them higher starting salaries than female applicants with identical resumes. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474">Read the study</a>.</p>

            <div class="bias-example">
                <h3>2. Confirmation Bias</h3>
                <p>Assuming a coworker is lazy based on one instance of missed deadlines and only noticing actions that confirm this belief.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A hiring manager might unconsciously favor a candidate from their alma mater, interpreting their accomplishments more positively while scrutinizing candidates from other universities more harshly. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797612457379">Read more about confirmation bias</a>.</p>

                <h3>3. Racial Bias in Healthcare</h3>
                <p>Studies show that Black patients are often prescribed less pain medication than White patients due to implicit biases in pain perception.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that medical students and residents often falsely believed that Black patients experience less pain than White patients, leading to disparities in pain management. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/113/16/4296">Read the study</a>.</p>

                <h3>4. Beauty Bias</h3>
                <p>Attractive individuals may be perceived as more competent or intelligent, leading to preferential treatment.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Research has found that attractive candidates receive higher ratings in job interviews, even when qualifications are identical. Beauty bias can also affect promotions and workplace relationships, reinforcing systemic inequalities. <a href="https://www.hipeople.io/glossary/beauty-bias">Learn more about beauty bias</a>.</p>

                <h3>5. Age Bias</h3>
                <p>Older employees may be seen as less capable of adapting to new technologies, while younger employees may be considered inexperienced.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Ageism is one of the last socially acceptable prejudices and has widespread effects in workplaces and healthcare settings. Research from the American Psychological Association (APA) highlights how negative aging stereotypes impact employment opportunities, healthcare access, and mental well-being. <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/03/cover-new-concept-of-aging">Read the APA article</a>.</p>

            <h2>Take the Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Implicit Association Test (IAT)</strong>, developed by researchers at Harvard University, helps measure unconscious biases by analyzing response times to different stimuli.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can take the test yourself to gain awareness of your biases and understand how they might influence your perceptions.
